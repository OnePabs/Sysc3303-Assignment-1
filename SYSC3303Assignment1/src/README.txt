General Information
------------------------
 - Java IDE is needed to run the program, preferably Eclipse
 - The order for running the program is important and specified in the
   running instructions section below
 - Local Ports might be already in use. If this is the case, an error
   message will appear saying so. When this happens, do the following
   1. right click on console and select terminate all
   2. repeat step 1
   3. right click on console and select remove all terminated
   4. Re-run the program
 - The servers have a maximum "listen" time. If no message is received
   during that time the server will time-out. After time-out the program
   will terminate. This maximum time is set to 8 seconds
